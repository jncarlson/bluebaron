                            <strong>Visualization:</strong> People for the most part are visual creatures. There's not many that can look at rows of textual data and notice important trends and
                            correlations. The best way to learn from data is to be able to visualize it. By creating detailed, consistent, and normalized visualizations BlueBaron.net allows you to view complex
                            data in simple and meaningful ways.

                            <strong>Configurable:</strong> There are many tools and websites that still use the antiquated method of showing static rows of data. BlueBaron.net is built as a fully fledged
                            application, allowing you to interact by filtering, re-arranging, and customizing almost every point of data.

                        meaning after your initial page load of visiting the site, all new data is loaded dynamically without refreshing your browser window.</p>

                            I actually do not determine the lane that you played. Riot does this themselves by seeing how much time you spend in a particular area of the map
                            during the start of the game. This is accurate most of the time, however it may be inaccurate on some games where you cross or change lanes.

                        <p style="color: rgb(215, 215, 216);">
                            There are two reasons I chose to make BlueBaron.net only for ranked games. The first and most important reason is because Riot has mentioned multiple times on their
                            development forum that they don't plan on including specific data for unranked games in the future. They want people to be able to play unranked games in order to try out
                            new strategies without being scrutinized by other players viewing them. The second reason is because BlueBaron.net is an improvement platform that analyzes and gives insight
                            into your game play. I don't see much value in analyzing unranked games when so many are filled with afk, trolls, or people just messing around in general.

                        <p style="color: rgb(215, 215, 216);">
                            This started initially as a pet project. I have only been programming for a couple years and wanted something fun to work on. Once I started playing League of Legends I
                            thought it would be awesome to have a site that that you could visit, enter in your summoner name, and see an objective analysis of your gameplay. The current sites that
                            existed seem to be really old fashion and aimed at a really young audience. I wanted to build something in an application framework with a more mature look.
